#%% Exercise 1
# Complete each comment below the statements. 
# Replace the ... with your answer.

result_a = "C" == 'C' 
# result_a is True because The expression checks if the string "C" is equal to the character 'C', and since they are the same, the result is True.
result_b = "F" or "K" 
# result_b is "F" because In Python, the or operator returns the first truthy value. Since "F" is a non-empty string (which is truthy), it is returned. 
result_c = "F" and "K" 
# result_c is "K" because The and operator returns the last evaluated argument if all are truthy. Both "F" and "K" are non-empty strings (truthy), so "K" is returned.
result_d = len("gtiit") >= len("GTIIT") 
# result_d is True because The length of both strings is 5, so the condition 5 >= 5 evaluates to True.
result_e = 'a' != 'A'
# result_e is True because In ASCII, lowercase letters have higher values than uppercase ones. 'a' (ASCII value 97) is greater than 'A' (ASCII value 65).
result_f = 'A' < 'Z' 
# result_f is True because In ASCII, 'A' (value 65) comes before 'Z' (value 90), so 'A' < 'Z' is True.
result_g = "GTIIT" == "gtiit"
# result_g is False because String comparison is case-sensitive, so "GTIIIT" and "gtiit" are not the same.
result_h = 0 and "GT" 
# result_h is  0 because The and operator stops at the first falsy value, which is 0, so it returns 0.
result_i = "GT" and 0 
# result_i is 0 because Both "GT" (truthy) and 0 (falsy) are evaluated, but the and operator returns the last value if the first is truthy, so 0 is returned. 
result_j = (6==7) and a_variable 
# result_j is False because The condition 6==7 is False, and the and operator short-circuits here, so a_variable is never evaluated. The result is False, and there is no error despite a_variable being undefined.
# Why does this work although a_variable doens't exist?
result_k = 0 or "" 
# result_k is ""  because The or operator returns the first truthy value. Here, both 0 and "" are falsy, so the last value, "", is returned.
result_l = "GTIIT" or 1/0 
# result_l is "GTIIIT" because The or operator short-circuits at the first truthy value, so "GTIIIT" is returned, and 1/0 (which would raise a ZeroDivisionError) is not evaluated.
# Why does this work although 1/0 gives ZeroDivisionError?
result_m = 0.00000001 + 1000000000 - 1000000000 > 0.0
# result_m is False because due to floating-point precision, the result might not be exactly 0.00000001. Instead, it is rounded down to 0.0, which makes the comparison 0.0 > 0.0 evaluate to False.
result_n = (2**0.5)**2 == 2
# result_n is False because due to the limited precision of floating-point arithmetic

#%% Exercise 2
# Get temperature 
temp = float(input("Enter the temperature value: "))
unit = input("Enter the unit (C, F, K): ").upper()

# Check 
if unit == 'C':
    # In Celsius, no conversion needed
    result = temp
    print(f"The temperature in Celsius is: {result:.2f}°C")
elif unit == 'F':
    # Fahrenheit to Celsius
    result = (temp - 32) * 5/9
    print(f"The temperature in Celsius is: {result:.2f}°C")
elif unit == 'K':
    # Kelvin to Celsius
    result = temp - 273.15
    print(f"The temperature in Celsius is: {result:.2f}°C")
else:
    # Handle invalid units
    print("Error: Invalid unit entered.")

#%% Exercise 3
# Get input from the user
students = int(input("Enter the number of students: "))
sodas = int(input("Enter the number of sodas: "))
pizzas = int(input("Enter the number of pizzas: "))
is_weekend = input("Is it the weekend? (Yes/No): ").strip().lower() == 'yes'

# Determine if the party is successful based on the criteria
is_successful = (
    (sodas >= 2 * pizzas and pizzas >= students / 2) if not is_weekend else
    (pizzas >= students and sodas > 2 * students)
)

# Print the result
print("Is the party successful? ", "Yes" if is_successful else "No")

#%% Exercise 4
# Get two strings
string1 = input("Enter the first string: ")
string2 = input("Enter the second string: ")

# Determine the shorter and longer strings
short = string1 if len(string1) <= len(string2) else string2
long = string1 if len(string1) > len(string2) else string2

# Print the output
output = short + long + short
print("Output string:", output)

#%% Exercise 5
# Ask the user for an integer number
num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

# Initialize the result as an empty string
result = ""

# Check divisibility by 3, 5, and 7 and append to result
result += "Fizz" if num % 3 == 0 else ""
result += "Buzz" if num % 5 == 0 else ""
result += "Daah" if num % 7 == 0 else ""

# Print the result or the number itself if not divisible by 3, 5, or 7
print(result if result else num)

#%% Exercise 6

# Fix the semantic errors in this code. 
# You need to fix 6 lines of code in total to make it work. 
# You don't have to write all the code again. 
# Just fix either a variable, operators, or indentation of code.
# Add a comment at each line explaining the fix.
